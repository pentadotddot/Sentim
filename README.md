# Sentim
A high level semi-automatic Discord moderator web-interface, with which user activities can be monitored in multiple ways, such as sentiment analysis, hate speech detection and fud detection, for multiple servers simultaneously, to ensure the best user experience possible. The easy-to-use and versatile web-interface makes it possible to manage high-throughput data management, giving roles, categorizing users according to their activities, protecting users from toxic behavior or rewarding them for being positive and supportive towards others or to the project itself.  Can be a real game changer in moderation and project-management, as it can spare hundreds of hours of moderation time in the long run, as multiple servers can be moderated simultaneously by a single moderator with the use of a few clicks.
